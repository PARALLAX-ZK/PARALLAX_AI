# PARALLAX

**Provable AI inference. Real-time compute. All onchain.**

PARALLAX is a next-generation decentralized AI infrastructure designed to integrate intelligent computation directly into the Web3 stack, starting with Solana.

Our mission is to unlock autonomous, trustless, and verifiable artificial intelligence onchain. By combining fast L2 rollups, cryptographic inference proofs, and seamless smart contract interoperability, PARALLAX provides developers, researchers, and dApps with the ability to run AI workloads in a secure, permissionless environment.

Whether you're building autonomous trading agents, real-time game AI, or governance-driven models, PARALLAX is the bridge between AI logic and blockchain execution.
